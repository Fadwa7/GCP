Job 11:  RUNNING REINDEER 
Reason: Missing output files: Results/REINDEER/index_reindeer/reindeer_index.gz; Input files updated by another job: Results/REINDEER/files_path.txt

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule multi_fastqc in file /home/el_fadwa1997/GCP/rules/multiqc.smk, line 1:
Job 7  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
Results/QC/Multiqc_report.html
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
