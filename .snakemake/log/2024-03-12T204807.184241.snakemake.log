Job 1: fetch fastq from NCBI
Reason: Missing output files: /home/el_fadwa1997/Results/Fastq_Files/ERR12022339_1.fastq.gz, /home/el_fadwa1997/Results/Fastq_Files/ERR12022339_2.fastq.gz

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule fetch_fastq in file /home/el_fadwa1997/GCP/rules/fastq.smk, line 30:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/el_fadwa1997/Results/Fastq_Files/ERR12022339_1.fastq.gz
/home/el_fadwa1997/Results/Fastq_Files/ERR12022339_2.fastq.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
