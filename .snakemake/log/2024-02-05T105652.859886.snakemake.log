MissingOutputException in rule sra_prefetch in file /home/el_fadwa1997/GCP/rules/fastq_test.smk, line 3:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
Results/Fastq_files/sra_prefetch/SRR7093892.sra
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
