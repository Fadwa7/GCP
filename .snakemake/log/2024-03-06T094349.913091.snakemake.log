MissingOutputException in rule multi_fastqc in file /home/el_fadwa1997/GCP/rules/multiqc.smk, line 21:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/el_fadwa1997/Results/QC/multiqc_report.html
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
